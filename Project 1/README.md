  Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website
 
About :- 
I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL.
I serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

To run: First, Clone the repository.
You can view the page by opening fresh_tomatoes.html. or Open any python ide and locate the file entertainment_center.py 
and load it. Run the file to see the required output.
